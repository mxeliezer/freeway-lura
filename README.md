Classic game based on Atari's Freeway

Hello everyone,

I brought here another exercise from my 'Programming Logic Course'. This time it's the recreation of the classic Atari game, **Freeway.

The game project was entirely done in **p5.js** Web Editor, with **Javascript, HTML and CSS**. I used some images and sounds provided by Alura's 'Classic Games' course. Then I edited and customized my final project, with colorful cars and putting the main actor as our beloved **Octocat.

The final result can be accessed at this link <https://editor.p5js.org/mxeliezer/full/Qrb9IPwo>.

All elements of the project can be accessed via Github.

Strength and Peace!
